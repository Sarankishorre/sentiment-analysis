This project implements a Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline to classify tweets into Positive, Negative, or Neutral sentiments.
It includes text preprocessing, feature extraction, and training of classification models to accurately predict the sentiment expressed in tweets.
The dataset also contains metadata (like time of tweet, user age, and country) which was explored for additional insights.
textID — unique tweet ID

text — full tweet text

selected_text — portion of text reflecting sentiment

sentiment — target sentiment label (positive, negative, neutral)

Time of Tweet — time slot of posting (morning, noon, night)

Age of User, Country, Population, Land Area, Density — user/location metadata
